<U><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Use</FONT></FONT></U>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Most of the options in DaiPak
are self-explanatory and have hint popups. Here are some extra notes.</FONT>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Importing files:</FONT></U>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">1: "Import to current directory" This
will import the file to the current selected directory.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">2: "Import to new directory" This will
import the files to a new subdirectory of the current selected directory.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">3: "Import tree" This will let you select
a directory and DaiPak will add al the files in the directory and it's
subdirectory's keeping the relative paths intact.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">4: Drop files from an explorer window,
this will add all the dropped files and directory's to the current directory.&nbsp;
This is probably the easiest option to add files.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The first two options will present you
with the "add files" dialog, the left side of the dialog are the files
on your disc and on the right side is the list of the files that will be
added to the pak.&nbsp; Use the "add button" to add the selected files
to the list or the "add all" button to add all the files at once.&nbsp;
To remove a file select it and press the delete key or use the clear button
to remove all the files.</FONT>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Exporting files:</FONT></U>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">1: "Export selected files" Will export
all the files (and directory's) selected in the file list, keeping their
path info, to the directory where the pakfile is located.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">2: "Export all files in directory" Will
export all the files (and directory's) of the current directory keeping
their path info, to the directory where the pakfile is located.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">3: "Export all" Will export all the files
in the pak keeping their path info, to the directory where the pakfile
is located.</FONT>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Deleting files:</FONT></U>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The delete file button will delete all
the selected files from the pack. If you want to delete a directory, remove
all the files from it and it will be automatically deleted.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Deleting files can take a long time since
the data in the pack must be moved to fill up the hole.</FONT>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Renaming files:</FONT></U>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Use the popup menu (right mouse button)
to rename the files. You can also drag files and directories from the list
to the list or the tree to move them.</FONT>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Updating files:</FONT></U>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Just use any of the add-files options
to update files in the pak. If the file already exists add options will
ask if you want to update it.</FONT>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Playing/Viewing files:</FONT></U>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Use the play button (or the popup menu)
to play sound files without extracting them or to view the file if it has
an associated program. The file will then be extracted to a temporally
file which will be deleted after viewing.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<U><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Problems/Questions</FONT></FONT></U>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">-Where is the "New directory button":
Sorry there isn't one since pak files can 't contain empty directories.
Use the "Move to new directory" option in the popup-menu to move the file
to a new directory.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">-You can't compress files in the pak.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">-There is a Refresh option in the edit
menu, it is used to save the current pak-directory and refresh the tree,
after an error you can sometimes save your pack with it.&nbsp; You should
not use it in normal circumstances since the pak is automatically saved.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
