Most of the options in DaiPak are self-explanatory and have hint popups.  Here are some extra notes.

Importing files:
1: "Import to current directory" This will import the file to the current selected directory.
2: "Import to new directory" This will import the files to a new subdirectory of the current selected directory.
3: "Import tree" This will let you select a directory and DaiPak will add al the files in the directory and it's subdirectory's keeping the relative paths intact.

Exporting files:
1: "Export selected files" Will export all the files (and directory's) selected in the file list, keeping their path info, to the directory where the pakfile is located.
2: "Export all files in directory" Will export all the files (and directory's) of the current directory keeping their path info, to the directory where the pakfile is located.
3: "Export all" Will export all the files in the pak keeping their path info, to the directory where the pakfile is located.

Deleting files:
The delete file button will delete all the selected files from the pack.  If you want to delete a directory, remove all the files from it and it will be automatically deleted.
Deleting files can take a long time since the data in the pack must be moved to fill up the hole.

Renaming files:
Use the popup menu (right mouse button) to rename the files.  You can also drag files and directories from the list to the list or the tree to move them.

Updating files:
Just use any of the add-files options to update files in the pak.  If the file already exists add options will ask if you want to update it.

Playing/Viewing files:
Use the play button (or the popup menu) to play sound files without extracting them or to view the file if it has an associated program.  The file will then be extracted to a temporally file which will be deleted after viewing.

Problems/Questions
------------------
-Where is the "New directory button":  Sorry there isn't one since pak files can 't contain empty directories.  Use the "Move to new directory" option in the popup to move the file to a new directory.

-You can't add compressed files
